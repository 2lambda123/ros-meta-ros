# Branch `legacy-v2`

This branch contains the legacy layer version 2 implementation of `meta-ros`
that can be used to build ROS 2 **crystal** and **dashing**, and the portion of
ROS 1 **melodic** required for the TurtleBot 3, using OpenEmbedded **thud** on
Ubuntu **bionic**. See
[here](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/OpenEmbedded-Build-Instructions/9b48b67e12c10e0d5a8eeca386ba79ba55a4d1d0)
for instructions.

It is no longer under active development, but will be retained until it is no
longer needed by the community. Pull requests for it will **not** be accepted.
