# UNDER CONSTRUCTION!

The original implementation of `meta-ros` for ROS 1 Indigo Igloo
(<https://github.com/bmwcarit/meta-ros> was transferred here on 2019-06-25. It
has been upgraded to be able to build packages from current ROS 1 and ROS 2
distros (Melodic Morenia, Dashing Diademata, Eloquent Elusor and eventually Foxy
Fitzroy) from recipes generated by
[superflore](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/superflore/)
for a number of recent OpenEmbedded release series. However, it is still
"under construction". Please see this
[wiki page](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/Superflore-OE-Recipe-Generation-Scheme)
for details of what is being done (and what has already been done). More-or-less
final versions of these changes are in the
`<OE-RELEASE-SERIES>-draft` branches, eg,
[`zeus-draft`](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/tree/zeus-draft).

Instructions for using `meta-ros` are
[here](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/wiki/OpenEmbedded-Build-Instructions).

The original implementation has been retained in the [`legacy`](https://github.com/ros/meta-ros/tree/legacy) branch.
