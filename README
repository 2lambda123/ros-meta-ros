This is a layer to provide ros in an openembedded linux system.
Currently, this layer is still under development and not fully functional.

PURPOSE of this document:
  This document describes
  - the installation, use and content of the git repository meta_ros 
  - milestones, the open issues and how some issues have been resolved. 
  - license information and origin of redistributed files


INSTALLATION:

  The repository only contains a layer for ros to be added to the existing yocto poky-danny-8.0 archive.

  To install, unpack http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/releases/yocto/yocto-1.3/poky-danny-8.0.tar.bz2 into a directory <dir>.
  In <dir>, clone this repository into the subdirectory meta-ros. 
  Add the meta-ros directory to your local bblayers.conf file 

USE for native compilation on the VM (milestone M1):
  The commands
    source oe-init-build-env
    bitbake core-image-ros
  builds our specifically configured linux image.
  
  With `runqemu qemux86-64 qemuparams="-m 2048" core-image-ros` the linux image runs within a virtual machine with 2048 MB of memory.
  We assumed that this is running on and compiled for an x86-64 architecture. For other architectures, some settings must be adjusted.
  
  On the host system, run fetch_ros.sh in a fresh directory, e.g. ~/ros-repos/.
  It clones all ros repositories locally.
  Then adjust pathes in fuerte-ros-base.rosinstall to the local repositories.
  After starting the virtual machine, copy the installation script from the host system to the home directory with scp and execute it.
  
    scp lukas@192.168.7.1:/<location of repository>/install.sh .
    sh ./install.sh

MILESTONES

  M1: basic image with dev-tools (make, cmake, ...) and ROS compiles natively in the virtual machine
  M2: Linux+ROS System can be built completely with bitbake (no compilation and installing in the virtual machine)
  M3: Linux+ROS System with configured kernel (e.g. RT-Linux, System-D) that meets real-time and safety requirements 

RESOLVED ISSUES for M1:

  - recipes for python-pyyaml and python-rospkg create invalid shell scripts (header line refers to python-native instead of python.)
    RESOLVED by patching distutils class--has be committed to oe-core.
  - recipe for log4cxx requires another patch.
    RESOLVED by providing patch 0003 in recipe
  - Compilation with make fails in the virtual machine because of insufficient memory during compilation.
    RESOLVED by increasing memory.
  
OPEN ISSUES for M1:

  - python-setuptools requires some python-modules at run-time.
    TEMPORARILY RESOLVED by adding all python-modules in the image
    SHOULD BE RESOLVED by creating an appropriate patch for python-setuptools and contributing to openembedded-core
  - rospkg modules are not found when runnning python.
    TEMPORARILY RESOLVED by installing natively in the virtual machine
    CAUSE of PROBLEM: must add /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/rospkg-1.0.15-py2.7.egg to PYTHON_PATH (sys.path)
    In the usual setting, this is done by adding rospkg-1.0.15-py2.7.egg to the easy-install.pth
    However, the distutils class removes the created easy-install.pth before packaging.
    Modifying the class, to not remove the easy-install.pth does not solve the issue, because
    also the python-setuptools must add an entry to easy-install.pth
    This can be only solved by providing a general merge mechanism for the easy-install.pth file.
    Implementing this should not be difficult because the format of this file is very easy, and
    the pathes can be simply accumulated.
    FIRST TEMPORARY SOLUTION: we simply write the easy-install.pth file in the rootfs task of the image generation.
    SECOND SOLUTION: implemented behavior described above
    THIRD SOLUTION: uses the dist_utils argument to use traditional packaging mechanism and avoid .egg files at all (suggested by Ross Burton)

OPEN ISSUES for M2:
  - understand what rosinstall actually does
  - how fetch from multiple git repositories in one recipe?

OPEN ISSUES for PUBLICATION:
  - Explain how to/write a script to obtain the files in ros_server
